# Using the website

Unfortunately, you can't actually ask Jaden questions and expect an answer. If you used the "get help" button on the website, you might notice you aren't getting any answers at all! That's the entire point, only those who know the secrets can have fun with the website.

Where the magic takes place is in the "repeat this phrase" input box. What appears as you type is the phrase, but behind the scenes, every key you press is saved in a variable, and this variable is the answer that will appear!

With this knowledge, you can trick non-suspecting people into thinking "Jaden" is answering your questions!

It's not this simple however, as your answer to your question might not be the same length as the phrase. For example, your question might be `Is it dark outside right now?` Typing this into the box will show `Jaden, please answer my questi.` This is obviously not going to trick anyone, as some bright individual will point out that you didn't even type the phrase right!

In order to work around this, you can "submit" your answer by simple typing `...` after your answer. This string, as well as any letters after it, will be deleted from your answer, and so you can finish typing out the phrase, knowing your answer is safe.

Then, simply type in your question, and hit the `Ask for answers` button, and viola, your answer appears!
